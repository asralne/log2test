# log2test
Log2Test is a simple PHP tool that allows you to transform your Production Log into test.  
You can export your log to the following stack:  
- PhpCurl: A good solution when you only log API calls. No Need to run Javascript or Ajax calls  
- PhpunitSelenium: You can choose wich browsers you want to test on your yaml configuration file  


Still in development (will soon be available on master)
